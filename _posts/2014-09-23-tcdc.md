title: Microsoft TCDC Closing

For the past 6 1/2 years I've worked for Microsoft out of the TCDC (Twin Cities Development Center) office. We were originally in Minneapolis, and moved to our more permanent home in Wells Fargo Place in downtown St. Paul.

During that time I worked on a variety of projects (which can be found on the [about](/about/) page). Some of the more interesting projects included:

* SketchFlow
* CSS parser for HTML design tools in Blend
* A mini-language lexer/parser for commands used to set properties in a CSS context/editor
* Design tooling for XAML/HTML in Visual Studio
* iOS client app for Office 365 Video project
* Azure backed service serving as the back end to the Office 365 Video project

As part of the company wide layoffs, it was announced on 2014/09/18 that the TCDC office would be closing, and almost all of the positions were being eliminated. I was included in that group.

So now begins a new adventure. I'm taking a little time here to figure out what I want to do next, but in the immediate moment I'm excited to try out some new technologies, and hopefully contribute to some open source projects. I've started using my github account again, and hope to have more interesting content there soon, now that I am able.
