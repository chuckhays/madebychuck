# Hi.

I'm a software developer "and whatever it takes" at Microsoft.

I've been at MSFT since I graduated from the University of Michigan and have had unique opportunities at Microsoft to help work on shipping several products from start through maturity, including Silverlight (a plug-in application platform for browsers) and the Windows Phone. Many of my projects have been open source and cross-platform.

I've worked on these products and projects:

- ASP.NET 2.0
- Silverlight 2
- Silverlight Toolkit (open source controls)
- Silverlight 3
- Silverlight 4
- Silverlight 5
- Windows Phone 7
- Windows Phone Toolkit (open source)
- Windows Phone 7.5
- Windows 8
- Windows Phone 8
- Windows Azure SDKs (open source)
- Windows Azure Command Line Tools (open source, cross-platform)
- Microsoft Azure Development Staff

Today I work on the Azure team on special assignment as a Principal SDE Architect and Technical Assistant to the CVP of Development. We're a different Microsoft: we often ship and develop our code in the open on GitHub.

I am also the developer of 4th &amp; Mayor, the top-rated social application on the Windows Phone Store, designed as a simple, crisp and easy third party client for the foursquare service.
